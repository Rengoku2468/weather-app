üå¶Ô∏è Weather App

A simple and functional Weather App built with vanilla JavaScript. It fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API and displays the current temperature, weather conditions, and location information.

This app allows users to search for a city and view its current weather. It displays temperature, condition (e.g., cloudy, sunny), and basic location details. Data is pulled from the OpenWeatherMap API using JavaScript's Fetch API.

Features include:

Search by city name

Real-time weather data

Temperature and condition display

Responsive design for mobile and desktop

Technologies used:

HTML for structure

CSS for styling

JavaScript for interactivity and API requests

OpenWeatherMap API for weather data

To use the app:

Folder structure:

Planned future improvements:

CSS styling will be enhanced to include a cleaner layout, smooth transitions, animations, and optional light/dark themes.

Add geolocation support to detect user‚Äôs current location and show weather automatically.

Add extended forecasts (hourly and 5-day).

Include dynamic weather icons that match current conditions.

This project was created to strengthen skills in JavaScript, especially working with the DOM, asynchronous functions, and handling API responses. Contributions are welcome if you‚Äôd like to help improve the app especially the css was too lazyüôÇ
